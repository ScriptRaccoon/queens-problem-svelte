# Solutions of the n queens problem

https://n-queens.netlify.app/

This is a visualization of the solutions of the [n queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle), made with Svelte. The solutions are created "on demand" with a generator function, since for large values of n the creation of all solutions would take too long.

There is also an edit feature which allows you to solve the problem on your own.
